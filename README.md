### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I encountered two errors:
1. This class is not key value coding-compliant for the key tableView
2. Unexpectedly found nil while implicitly unwrapping an Optional value

I fixed them by:
1. Checking the 'Inherit Module From Target' checkbox
2. Remapping the tableView outlet
